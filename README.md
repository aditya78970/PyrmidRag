Pyramid Ingest is a lightweight document processing and retrieval pipeline that builds a multi-level "Knowledge Pyramid" from raw text. It extracts summaries, categories, and keywords per chunk, embeds each level, and enables fast semantic search with FAISS and fuzzy fallback. Ideal for intelligent search systems.
